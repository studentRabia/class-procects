#Problem Statement
#Use Python to calculate the number of seconds in a year, and tell the user what the result is in a nice print statement that looks like this (of course the value 5 should be the calculated number instead):
#
#There are 5 seconds in a year!
#
#You should use constants for this exercise -- there are 365 days in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds per minute.



def main():
    # Constants
    DAYS_IN_YEAR = 365
    HOURS_IN_DAY = 24
    MINUTES_IN_HOUR = 60
    SECONDS_IN_MINUTE = 60
    print("\n \t📆 Welcome to the Seconds in Year Calculator!")
    print("-" * 80) 
    print("📄 🖋  Let's calculate the number of seconds in a year.\n")
    # Calculation
    seconds_in_year = DAYS_IN_YEAR * HOURS_IN_DAY * MINUTES_IN_HOUR * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE

    # Display result
    print(f"\nThere are '{seconds_in_year}' seconds in a year❕")
