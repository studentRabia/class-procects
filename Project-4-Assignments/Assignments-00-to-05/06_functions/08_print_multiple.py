#Problem Statement
#Fill out print_multiple(message, repeats), which takes as parameters a string message to print, and an integer repeats number of times to print message. We've written the main() function for you, which prompts the user for a message and a number of repeats.
#
#Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in blue):
#
#Please type a message: Hello! Enter a number of times to repeat your message: 6 Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!

print("\nwelcome to the program of print_multiple time of message. ")
print("-"*70)

def main():
    message = input("\nPlease type a message: ")
    repeats = int(input("Enter a number of times to repeat your message: "))
    print_multiple(message, repeats)

def print_multiple(message, repeats):
    for _ in range(repeats):
        print(message, end=' ')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
